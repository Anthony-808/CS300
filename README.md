# Project Overview

The projects in this course involved selecting and implementing a data structure that best fit a specific scenario. I approached this challenge using a three-step process: performing an asymptotic analysis of the available data structures, determining which one aligned best with the task’s requirements, and implementing it.

The first step was particularly important, as it allowed me to develop an understanding of each data structure’s strengths and weaknesses—an understanding that was crucial to making the right choice. Once I had selected the appropriate data structure, I encountered a roadblock in figuring out how to implement it effectively. To overcome this, I conducted online research to understand best practices and explore the tools available to me. This approach allowed me to plan and execute a successful implementation.

My work on this project helped me develop the habit of considering algorithm efficiency instead of just the simplest implementation. As I applied that mindset, I also improved my ability to determine when to use helper functions and how to effectively integrate class-based code with functional code, allowing me to organize logic in a way that’s both readable and adaptable.
